Hi, I’m Suwei Ma!

I’m currently a first year Ph.D student at the Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, advised under [Professor Sebastian Angel](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sga001/) and [Professor Linh Thi Xuan Phan](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~linhphan/). My research interests center heavily around the intersection of operating systems and creative appplications of AI, and I'm also currently diving into fields such as security and resource allocation. 

At Columbia, I've had the privilege to work with distinguished faculty members such as [Professor Junfeng Yang](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/), [Professor Baishakhi Ray](https://www.rayb.info/), [Professor Suman Jana](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~suman/), and [Dr. Tony Dear](https://tonydear.com/). My previous research focused primarily on the applications of large language models in regards to Linux kernel stability, and tasks such as credit scoring. Along the way, I’ve had the privilege of publishing my work at leading NLP conferences like EMNLP.
 
Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect, chat about research, or just share cool ideas.
