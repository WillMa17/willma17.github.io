Hi, I’m Suwei Ma!

I’m currently an undergraduate senior studying Computer Science at Columbia University, where I’ve been diving deep into AI, systems programming, and everything in between. My research focuses on exciting topics like large language models, Linux kernel stability, and creative ways to use AI in real-world applications like credit scoring. Along the way, I’ve had the privilege of publishing my work at leading NLP conferences like EMNLP.

At Columbia, I've had the privilege to work with distinguished faculty members such as [Professor Junfeng Yang](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/), [Professor Baishakhi Ray](https://www.rayb.info/), [Professor Suman Jana](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~suman/), and [Dr. Tony Dear](https://tonydear.com/).

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect, chat about research, or just share cool ideas. I'm also actively looking for Ph.D opportunities for Fall 2025.
